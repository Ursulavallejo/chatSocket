### 🎲 Real-Time Dice Game with Chat – Built with Socket.IO

This project is an individual assignment developed for **Labb 3** in the Backend Programming course. 
It features a real-time multiplayer dice game using **Socket.IO** on both the frontend and backend. 
The application allows multiple users to connect simultaneously and interact in real time.

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Key Features

* **User Login with Avatar:** Users join the game by selecting their name and gender. Based on the gender, the app fetches a corresponding profile picture from a public API to create a personalized avatar.
* **Live Dice Game:** Each user can roll a die. The result is sent to the server and broadcast to all connected clients, displaying the user's name and score in real time.
* **Real-Time Chat:** All connected users can send and receive messages instantly in a public chat window.
* **User Persistence:** User data and dice results are stored and updated during the session.
* **Multiple Clients Demo:** The app is designed to be used by several users at once, tested using two or more browser tabs to simulate different participants.

#### 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Socket.IO client
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO server
